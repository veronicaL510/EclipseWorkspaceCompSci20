Choose Wisely.
Your name is Rebly.
Rebly wakes up in their room.
You wake up with only underwear on.
You hear glass breaking outside.
You look out the window and zombies are overrunning the place.
You know you have to make quick decisions.
Your options are
1: Jump out the Window(Potential Danger)
2: Walk out of the Room(Potential Danger) 
Enter a Number for your Choice, Remember Both have potential Danger
2
You end up in your kitchen.
You hear a noise coming from the basement
Go to see what caused the noise? or Stay?
Choose 1 to Go, Choose 2 to Stay
2
You return to the kitchen.
You have to make a choice whether to leave the house and find people, or stay and make a hideout?
Enter 1 to leave, or Enter 2 to Stay
2
Ok, well if we're going to stay we might as well secure this place.
There's a couple of things that you could take apart.
Would you like to take apart the chair's, the table's, or the cabinet's?
There are 3 chair's and each chair gives 4 wood
There is 1 table and it gives 10 wood
There are 7 cabinets which give 3 wood each.
You require 21 wood to complete the house, you only have enough energy to take apart 1 item.
Enter 1 for chair's, 2 for table's, 3 for Cabinets

Calculating...
...........
If only there was another table than you would be good.
But sadly I think your math is a bit off

You leave the house to try and find people
The moment you leave the house you see people
The people you have found are your family members.
Congratulations!
You have succesfully found your family!
And without dying too!
I hope....
Would you like to play again or End?
Enter 1 to play again or 2 to End.
